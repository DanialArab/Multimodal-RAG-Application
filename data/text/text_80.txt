As written in the paper, it is possible to perform variational inference on both the parameters θ and the latent variables z, as opposed to just the latent variables as we did in the paper. Here, we’ll derive our estimator for that case.
Let pα(θ) be some hyperprior for the parameters introduced above, parameterized by α. The marginal likelihood can be written as:
