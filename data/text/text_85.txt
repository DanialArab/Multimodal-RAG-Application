The expectations on the RHS of eqs (14) and (16) can obviously be written as a sum of three separate expectations, of which the second and third component can sometimes be analytically solved, e.g. when both pθ(x) and qφ(z|x) are Gaussian. For generality we will here assume that each of these expectations is intractable.
