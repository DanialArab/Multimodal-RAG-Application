2.3 The SGVB estimator and AEVB algorithm
In this section we introduce a practical estimator of the lower bound and its derivatives w.r.t. the parameters. We assume an approximate posterior in the form qφ(z|x), but please note that the technique can be applied to the case qφ(z), i.e. where we do not condition on x, as well. The fully variational Bayesian method for inferring a posterior over the parameters is given in the appendix.
Under certain mild conditions outlined in section|2.4}for a chosen approximate posterior qg(z|x) we can reparameterize the random variable Z ~ qg(z]X) using a differentiable transformation g¢(€, x) of an (auxiliary) noise variable e:
