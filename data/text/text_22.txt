From a coding theory perspective, the unobserved variables z have an interpretation as a latent representation or code. In this paper we will therefore also refer to the recognition model qφ(z|x) as a probabilistic encoder, since given a datapoint x it produces a distribution (e.g. a Gaussian) over the possible values of the code z from which the datapoint x could have been generated. In a similar vein we will refer to pθ(x|z) as a probabilistic decoder, since given a code z it produces a distribution over the possible corresponding values of x.
