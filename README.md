# Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 


This project implements a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of processing and querying information from PDF documents containing 
- text,
- images,
- tables, and
- formulas.

It integrates various components to extract, embed, index, and retrieve multimodal data, facilitating advanced question-answering capabilities.

query = "How is the marginal likelihood is calculated?"

The marginal likelihood is calculated as a sum over the marginal likelihoods of individual datapoints, which can be expressed as:

log p(x₁, ..., xₙ) = ∑[log p(xᵢ)]

where p(xᵢ) is the marginal likelihood of each individual datapoint xᵢ.

This can be further rewritten using equations (20) and (18) to derive a Monte Carlo estimate of the variational lower bound for a given datapoint x(i), which involves choosing a prior p(θ) and a function g(θ, x) that satisfies certain conditions.

In essence, the marginal likelihood calculation involves summing up the logarithmic probabilities of each individual datapoint in the dataset.



query = "What does reparameterization of the variational lower bound yield?"

The reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator, denoted as ~ L(0, ; x). This allows for the application of stochastic gradient descent to optimize the variational parameters, making it possible to learn the model using backpropagation. The reparameterization trick enables the Monte Carlo estimation of the variational lower bound, which is a key component of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and other deep generative models.

In essence, reparameterization helps to:

Convert a non-differentiable stochastic node into a differentiable one.
Enable backpropagation through the variational lower bound, allowing for end-to-end learning of the model.
Improve the stability and efficiency of training by avoiding the need for REINFORCE-style score function estimators.
By reparameterizing the variational lower bound, you can obtain a more efficient and stable estimate of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is essential for training VAEs and other deep generative models.
