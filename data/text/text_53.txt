Figure 3: Comparison of AEVB to the wake-sleep algorithm and Monte Carlo EM, in terms of the estimated marginal likelihood, for a different number of training points. Monte Carlo EM is not an on-line algorithm, and (unlike AEVB and the wake-sleep method) can’t be applied efﬁciently for the full MNIST dataset.
Visualisation of high-dimensional data If we choose a low-dimensional latent space (e.g. 2D), we can use the learned encoders (recognition model) to project high-dimensional data to a low- dimensional manifold. See appendix A for visualisations of the 2D latent manifolds for the MNIST and Frey Face datasets.
