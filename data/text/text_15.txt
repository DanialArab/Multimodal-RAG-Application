Abstract
How can we perform efﬁcient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differ- entiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using stan- dard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made espe- cially efﬁcient by ﬁtting an approximate inference model (also called a recogni- tion model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reﬂected in experimental results.
