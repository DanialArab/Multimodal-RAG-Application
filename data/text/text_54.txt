6 Conclusion
We have introduced a novel estimator of the variational lower bound, Stochastic Gradient VB (SGVB), for efﬁcient approximate inference with continuous latent variables. The proposed estima- tor can be straightforwardly differentiated and optimized using standard stochastic gradient meth- ods. For the case of i.i.d. datasets and continuous latent variables per datapoint we introduce an efﬁcient algorithm for efﬁcient inference and learning, Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB), that learns an approximate inference model using the SGVB estimator. The theoretical advantages are reﬂected in experimental results.
