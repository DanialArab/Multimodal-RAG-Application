D Marginal likelihood estimator
We derived the following marginal likelihood estimator that produces good estimates of the marginal likelihood as long as the dimensionality of the sampled space is low (less then 5 dimensions), and sufﬁcient samples are taken. Let pθ(x,z) = pθ(z)pθ(x|z) be the generative model we are sampling from, and for a given datapoint x(i) we would like to estimate the marginal likelihood pθ(x(i)).
The estimation process consists of three stages:
