We want to differentiate and optimize the lower bound £(6,@;x“)) wart. both the variational parameters @ and generative parameters 9. However, the gradient of the lower bound w.rt. @ is a bit problematic. The usual (naive) Monte Carlo gradient estimator for this type of problem is: VeEgy(z) [f(2)] = Eqycz) [Lf (2) Vag log ga(2)] ~ $ Tiki (Voge) log g(a) where Zo) qo(2z|x). This gradient estimator exhibits exhibits very high variance (see e.g. [BJP12]) and is impractical for our purposes.
