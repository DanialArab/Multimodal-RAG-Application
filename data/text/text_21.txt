For the purpose of solving the above problems, let us introduce a recognition model qφ(z|x): an approximation to the intractable true posterior pθ(z|x). Note that in contrast with the approximate posterior in mean-ﬁeld variational inference, it is not necessarily factorial and its parameters φ are not computed from some closed-form expectation. Instead, we’ll introduce a method for learning the recognition model parameters φ jointly with the generative model parameters θ.
