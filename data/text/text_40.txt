As explained in section we sample from the posterior 2) ~ qg(z|x) using 26 = g6(xX,€) = pO +o © € where € ~ N(0,1). With © we signify an element-wise product. In this model both pg(z) (the prior) and gg(z|x) are Gaussian; in this case, we can use the estimator of eq where the KL divergence can be computed and differentiated without estimation (see appendix [B). The resulting estimator for this model and datapoint x“ is:
