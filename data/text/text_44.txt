We trained generative models of images from the MNIST and Frey Face datasets3 and compared learning algorithms in terms of the variational lower bound, and the estimated marginal likelihood.
The generative model (encoder) and variational approximation (decoder) from section 3 were used, where the described encoder and decoder have an equal number of hidden units. Since the Frey Face data are continuous, we used a decoder with Gaussian outputs, identical to the encoder, except that the means were constrained to the interval (0,1) using a sigmoidal activation function at the
